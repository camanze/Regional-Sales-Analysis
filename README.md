# Regional-Sales-Analysis

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

This project leverages Power BI to analyze a sample superstore’s regional sales performance across Central, Eastern, Southern, and Western regions from 2010 to 2013. The dashboard provides actionable insights into Total Sales, Total Quantity Sold, and Total Profit, segmented by region, year, customer segment, and product category. Interactive visualizations enable stakeholders to dynamically explore trends, identify strengths/weaknesses, and comparing year-on-year performance—this dashboard transforms raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights.

The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle. [Click here to access it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset)

**Dashboard Features and Components**

- **Key Metrics:** Total Sales, Total Quantity, Total Profit.

- **Regional Segmentation:** Four geographic regions (Central, Eastern, Southern, Western).

- **Dynamic Parameters:** Users can toggle between metrics (Sales, Qty, Profit) and years (2010–2013).

- **Calculation of YoY Change:** Each region’s metric card displays year-on-year percentage change, with positive values conditionally formatted in green and negatives in red.

- **Metric Cards:** For each region, three cards show the selected metric’s value and its % YoY.

- **Trend Analysis (Line Chart):** Plots monthly trends of the chosen metric for a quick view of seasonality and momentum.

- **Quantitative Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Ranks sub-categories (e.g., Customer Segment, Product Category) by contribution to the selected metric.

- **Comparative Composition (Donut Chart):** Illustrates part-to-whole shares—such as which product categories or segments drive profitability in each region.

- **Interactive Buttons:** Seamlessly switch between metrics and filter by year to explore “what-if” scenarios.

**Regional Insights**

Considering the figures and business performance for 2013 as shown in the screenshot below, the following insights are drawn;

- **Central Region:** Strong growth with robust Sales and Quantity YoY gains; Profit up double-digits, driven by Corporate and Home Office segments.

- **Eastern Region:** Exceptional Profit surge, outpacing Sales growth—signaling improved margin management and customer mix.

- **Southern Region:** Moderate Sales growth but extraordinary Profit YoY spikes, suggesting lean operations and high-value transactions.

- **Western Region:** Sales and Quantity grew steadily, but a Profit decline underscores margin pressure—prompting deeper cost and pricing analysis.

**Comparative Analysis**

Layering all four regions reveals:

- **Divergent Profit Trends:** While Eastern and Southern regions are maximizing margins, the Western region’s negative Profit trend flags pricing or cost challenges.

- **Seasonal Patterns:** Consistent mid-year peaks across regions highlight promotional or peak buying seasons that can be further leveraged.

- **Product & Segment Leaders:** Technology and Office Supplies dominate Sales and Profit share, but Furniture shows potential with higher per-unit margins in specific regions.

   - Reassess pricing or support for Consumer segments and low-margin product categories.

4. **Adopt Continuous Data Monitoring**

   - Use dashboards to track KPIs in real-time and adapt strategies regularly, turning insights into strategic actions.
